jbulletd
========

A fork of  jbullet-20101010 (jbullet.advel.cz).

It uses Double instead of Float in the calculations and will only focus on static raycasts/collisions.

The original jbullet is optimized for dynamic performance, this fork will probably change that.

Heads up notice: If you fork this repo you should be aware that the entire dynamic package might be deleted since i don't have the time (or knowledge) to check if static optimizations breaks something in the dynamics package.
